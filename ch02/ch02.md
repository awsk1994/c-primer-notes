# Chapter 2: Variables and Basic Types

### 2.2.1. Arithmetic Types

 - 2 categories: integral types (incl character and boolean types) and floating-point types

 - Types: 
   - bool, char, wchar_t, char16_t, char32_t, short, int, long, long long, float, double, long double.

   - char type is guaranteed to be big enough to hold numeric values corresponding to the characters in the machine's **basic** character set.
   - wchar_t type is guaranteed to be large enough to hold any character in the machine's **largest** extended cahracter set.
   - char16_t and char32_t are intended for Unicode characters.
   - numerical types based on integer range: short <= int <= long <= long long

**Signed and Unsigned Types**

 - except for bool and character, the integral types may be signed or unsigned.
 - **signed** represent negative or positive numbers (including 0)
 - **unsigned** represent only values greater than or equal to zero.

 - There are two types of char; signed and unsigned char. The default char is one of these two, and which one it is depends on the compiler.

### 2.1.2. Type Conversion

```cpp
bool b = 42;  // b is true
int i = b;    // i has value 1
i = 3.14;     // i has value 3
double pi = i; // pi has value 3.0.
unsigned char c = -1; // assume 8-bit chars, c has value 255.
signed char c2 = 256; // assume 8-bit chars, the value of c2 is undefined.
```
```cpp
int i = 24;
if(i) // condition will evaluate as true
  i = 0;
```

**Character and Character String Literals:**

 - Compiler appends a null character ('\\0') to every string literal.
 - Thus, the actual size of a string literal is one more than its apparent size.
 - Eg: 'A' represents a single character, but string literal "A" represents an array of two characters; letter 'A' and null character.

**Escape Sequences**

 - We can write a generalized escape sequence, which is \x followed by one or more hexidecimal digits or a \ followed by one, two or three octal digits.

 For example:
 ```
 \115 ('M')
 \x4d ('M')
 ```
 ```cpp
 std::cout << "Hi \x4dO\115!\n"
;
// print: Hi MOM!!(newline)
```
